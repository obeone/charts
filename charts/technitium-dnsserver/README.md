Technitium DNS Server is a powerful and versatile DNS solution that can serve multiple purposes, from enhancing your network security by blocking ads and trackers (similar to Pi-hole or AdGuardHome) to acting as a robust authoritative DNS server for your domains. This Helm chart simplifies its deployment on Kubernetes, allowing you to leverage its advanced features with ease.

## Features

* **Ad-blocking & Privacy**: Block unwanted ads, malware, and tracking domains across your network.
* **Authoritative DNS**: Host your own DNS zones and manage records for your domains.
* **DNS-over-TLS (DoT)**: Secure your DNS queries with encryption.
* **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)**: Provide encrypted DNS resolution over HTTPS.
* **DHCP Server**: Integrate DHCP services for dynamic IP address assignment.
* **Web Interface**: Manage all settings and monitor DNS activity through an intuitive web UI.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment

To deploy Technitium DNS Server with default settings:

```bash
helm install technitium-dnsserver technitium-dnsserver/
```

### Enabling Ad-blocking

To enable ad-blocking, you might need to configure specific environment variables or mount a custom configuration. Refer to the official Technitium DNS Server documentation for detailed ad-blocking setup.

### Exposing the Web Interface via Ingress

To access the web interface through an Ingress controller, you can configure the `ingress.main` section in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
ingress:
  main:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - host: dns.yourdomain.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - dns.yourdomain.com
        secretName: dns-tls-secret
```
